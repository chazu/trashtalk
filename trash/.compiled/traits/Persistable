# Persistable trait - provides database persistence for objects
# Objects including this trait can be saved to and loaded from the Store (SQLite).
#
# Usage:
#   Counter subclass: Object
#     include: Persistable
#     instanceVars: value:0
#
#   # Create and save in one step
#   counter=$(@ Counter create)
#
#   # Or create, modify, then save
#   counter=$(@ Counter new)
#   @ $counter increment
#   @ $counter save
#
#   # Query persisted objects
#   @ Counter findAll           # All saved Counter instances
#   @ Counter find 'value > 5'  # Filtered query
#   @ Counter count             # Number of saved instances
